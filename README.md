# Sportsbook-arbitrage-bot

issues:
1) arbitrage opportunities are rare and hard to find, so it's very unlikely to new you much profit a month.
2) when an arbitrage opportunity is found, it is changed in sportsbooks almost immediately (they have the same tools to locate their mess ups)
3) it can be configured to scrape the sportsbook through a sportsbook account, but using theOddsAPI was often times better and easier.
4) for free use of theOddsAPI you can only do about 500 requests a month, or 16 requests a day. (its still a lot)

instructions to build: copy and paste the code onto you IDE that runs python. Paste your email address into any slot that says "Your_Email" and then obtain a passkey from google after setting up two step verification in order to
paste your passkey into the "Password" slot. Obtain a API key from theOddsAPI and paste in the API key slot. (it can be used with different API's, with minor modifications, but theOddsAPi is probably the best one for this).

after putting all of this together, press the "run project" button and if it was successful you should recieve a email to your recipient email account.
